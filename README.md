# givdo_app_new

This is a new Ionic app with Facebook authentication features.

I created this for the following reason.

I tried to refactor Facebook authentication on our past frontend app named "givdo_app". 
But, I couldn't succeed. One this was that the old Facebook authentication was complicated 
and less commented to understand. I didn't know how they work and which part was still necessary
and unnecessary. Another thing is that the old frontend depends on old npm modules. When I change them
for refactoring Facebook authentication, it caused a chain of errors relating npm modules.
